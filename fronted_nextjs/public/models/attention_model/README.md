This folder contains a placeholder TF.js model used during development to avoid 404s when the app checks for `/models/attention_model/model.json`.

To replace with a trained model, put your TF.js Layers format model files here (e.g. `model.json` and corresponding shard files). You can generate a demo model using the `scripts/create_demo_model.js` script if your environment supports `@tensorflow/tfjs-node`.
